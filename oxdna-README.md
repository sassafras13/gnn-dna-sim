# oxDNA README

This document provides an overview of how a simulation in oxdna should be set up and run. For more detailed information see the References section below.   

Typically 3 rounds of simulation are run sequentially on a structure in oxDNA:  
1. **Minimization step** - this minimizes the distances between each nucleotide to account for any artificially large distances that may have been generated by the structure design software.  
2. **Relaxation step** - this allows the structure to relax any repulsive or attractive forces that may be generated based on the position of the nucleotides after the minimization step.   
3. **Simulation step** - this step allows the structure to fully equilibriate and reach a steady state configuration in realistic environmental conditions (temperature, salt concentration).   

There are parameters used to define each step of the simulation. Please see reference [1] for a detailed explanation, as well as the files `input_min`, `input_relax` and `input_sim` for example files. Reference [2] provides some more explanation on molecular dynamics simulations.
