# Procedure for Generating Dataset

This README outlines how we generated a dataset containing simple dsDNA strands as well as 2D and 3D DNA wireframe structures.

## Simple dsDNA Strand Design

This work is conducted inside the ```dsDNA``` subfolder. We create a 20bp dsDNA strand and generate 10 trajectories for it as a simple dataset we can use for development. The strand sequence is designed to have minimal hairpins and other secondary structures, as well as a GC content of 50%. We used IDT's OligoAnalyzer tool to ensure this design met these requirements. The sequence is: 

```
ATG GCT TCG TGA CCT CAA GT
```

We save this as dsDNA.txt. To generate the dsDNA structure as a topology and a configuration file for oxDNA, we run the following command:

```
${OXDNA}/UTILS/generate-sa.py <side length> <filename>
${OXDNA}/UTILS/generate-sa.py 20. dsDNA.txt
```

We then run the script ```run.sh``` to generate a trajectory. We copy over the runtimes for min, relax and sim to a text file. The output subfolders and this text file are then saved outside the repo as one trajectory. 

We can analyze the results of a trajectory using the ```run_analysis.sh``` script in the ```dataset-generation``` folder. Be sure to update its directory to point it to the folder containing the files you want to analyze.

## Structure Design in Athena
We used Athena to generate .PDB files from several of the 2D and 3D structures in the tool's library. These .PDB files were converted to .top and .oxdna files using tacoxDNA, via the following command:

```
python3 PDB_oxdna.py <input filename> 53 
```

## Selecting oxDNA Parameters
We generated trajectories for each structure by running a 3-part simulation in oxDNA. First the structure was briefly **minimized**, then it was **relaxed** and finally we **simulated** the equilibriated structure. The min/relax/sim input files are contained in this subdirectory. This is a [useful description](https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Documentation) of all the parameters in the input files. We **save the output to terminal** to record the running time of the simulations for comparison with other baseline tests later.

We use oxView to visualize the results of each step in the simulation process. We can save GIFs of the trajectories, and we select 3 pairs of nucleotides to track. Each pair spans a characteristic dimension of the structure - the goal is to understand when the structure equilibriates at a steady state configuration. The figure below shows how we select the base pairs in oxView.

We then feed the base pairs and a number of other files from the simulation run into a custom script that calls [oxDNA analysis tools](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools) to plot the distance between the pairs during the simulation below. This script also calculates the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) for the input trajectory, and saves the results as a JSON file that can be overlaid on the topology + trajectory (.dat) files in oxView. The custom script  ```runOxdna.py``` can be called as:

```
python3 runOxdna.py -b <list of base pairs> -x <directory to oxdna-analysis-tools> -d <directory to save deviations JSON> -o <directory for output file> -i <oxDNA input file location> -t <trajectory file location>

python3 runOxdna.py -b /home/emma/Documents/Classes/10-707/final-project/wireframe-dataset/hexagon_base_pairs.csv -x /home/emma/repos/oxdna_analysis_tools -d /home/emma/Documents/Classes/10-707/final-project/wireframe-dataset/hexagon_deviations.json -o /home/emma/Documents/Classes/10-707/final-project/wireframe-dataset/ -i /home/emma/Documents/Classes/10-707/final-project/wireframe-dataset/input_sim -t /home/emma/Documents/Classes/10-707/final-project/wireframe-dataset/trajectory_sim.dat
```

TODO: Add a bash script that does this all for a given shape.

The data products that we save for each structure and each trajectory include:
* ```terminal_output.txt```: a copy of the printout generated by oxdna as the simulation ran (generated once and includes data for all simulation runs combined)   
* ```energy_*.dat```: the energy data for each simulation run
* ```trajectory_*.dat```: the trajectory data for each simulation run
* ```last_conf_*.dat```: the final configuration of the structure for each simulation run
* ```rmsf_*_data.json```: the RMSF data for the simulation (can be added as an overlay to the .top and .dat files in oxView to show RMSF for each nucleotide)  
* ```energy.png```: plots the variation of the total energy over the simulation run
* ```rmsf_*_plot.png```: plots the average RMSF for each time step compared to the total average RMSF over all time steps   

Figure 2 shows the units used by the oxDNA simulation tool.
