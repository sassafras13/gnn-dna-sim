- my model now trains and I think it is learning something because it is showing a decreasing training loss
- however, the rollouts are still not very good - they show random motion that is still in the right region of the initial structure but are not cohesive
- I want to debug this issue to get a better prediction for these basic structures 
- I can change small things about how this model is working, but there are also more features I can introduce into how this model works to make it more robust, as well.

- things I can tweak about current model:
---> size of latent dimension -- I tried doubling it and it made no significant difference, also slows down by 2x
---> remove the learning rate scheduler -- it still explodes, but it doesn't do any worse, so I'll keep it off
---> check to see if I can do this with an MLP
---> further increase the size of the latent dimension
---> change the learning rate

- things I can do to improve model robustness:
---> normalize inputs
---> include several previous time steps into the prediction
---> introduce relative instead of absolute position data
---> add more graph net layers
