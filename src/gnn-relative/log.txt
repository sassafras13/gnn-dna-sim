2023-08-26: 
- currently writing up code to produce a relative edge_attr that doesn't just contain 1s
- use the COO representation of the adjacency matrix to get the E matrix
- just gotta remember what the COO matrix representation is

2023-08-27:
- wrote a README in the dataset-generation/ subdirectory on how to generate new trajectories for training
- generated 20 additional trajectories -- at 30 total now
- updated the gnn relative to work, just need to re-write the rollout function
- ran on the absolute gnn -- try reducing the number of validation trajectories relative to training trajectories (currently 24 -- 5)

2023-09-02:
- fixed the rollout function for gnn relative
- going to try running the absolute gnn again. I reviewed the loss curve and it actually looks like the model just overfit, so I'm going to reduce the latent dimension from 128 to 64 and see what I get. 
- did that and got slightly better results in terms of the shape of the loss curve
- going to run the same parameters with my relative GNN overnight -- tomorrow, do the MLP
