- currently trying to install Tensorflow 1.15 using miniconda
- to run Tensorflow 1.15.3 I need python 3.5 so I am creating a conda
  environment py35 that has Python3.5 and Tensorflow 1.15.3
- will continue to run setup for the rest of the requirements.txt before
  trying to train the actual model
