- currently trying to install Tensorflow 1.15 using miniconda
- to run Tensorflow 1.15.3 I need python 3.5 so I am creating a conda
  environment py35 that has Python3.5 and Tensorflow 1.15.3
- will continue to run setup for the rest of the requirements.txt before
  trying to train the actual model
- can save requirements packages using pip freeze > name.txt
- downloaded WaterDropSample data -- don't download the others, require GB of
  space!

- I realized that I really need dm-tree, dm-sonnet adn graph-nets but I am
  erroring out. I think it is either because I need Python 3.6 or I need to
install Bazel.
- I installed Bazel by installing npm and then $npm install -g @bazel/bazelisk
- Install items in a requirements file via $pip install -r requirements.txt
- To create a conda environment for a particular python version: $conda create --name py33 python=3.3
- To create a requirements file: $pip freeze > requirements.txt
- Recreated a conda environment in Python 3.6 in lab computer and running
  training on that machine
- So I know that I have the code up and running, now the question is: How does
  the model want me to present the data so that it can learn from it? 
-- to answer this I need to look at my WaterDropSample dataset and see how to
recreate that data format with my information
- there is data contained in the tfrecord and in the metadata
-- in tfrecords there is particle type for key = 0 and key = 1
-- the particle type is either 000 or 005
- in the metadata:
-- bounding box dimensions
-- sequence length
-- default connectivity radius
-- dimensions (2 in this case - i.e. x and y dimensions?)
-- dt (time step)
-- mean and std dev of velocity
-- mean and std dev of acceleration
